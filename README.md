# Voronoi
Voronoi in OpenGL


This is an older attempt to make a Voronoi program in C using OpenGL. It worked when I last ran it. It was copied from my main Graphics folder on 28/03/2021.

The main graphics attempt has progressed considerably since then, and thus this uses some older techniques, such as shaders being included as character arrays in a text file.
